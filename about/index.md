Iâ€™m Hannah, a Junior at Penn State University, excited to explore where tech can lead me. I am studying Human Centered Design and Development (HCDD), and want to pursue a career in UX Design or Front End Web Development. When I was deciding what I wanted to do with my life two passions stood out to me, people and technology. These interests led me to where I am today. That is, aspiring to make technology easily accessible and seeking to design useful products to assist in daily activities. I want to make a positive difference in the world.
